## Overview
This repository contains the data and code we used for our final project. Data comes from the paper "Bacterial Biofilm Thickness and Fungal Inhibitory Bacterial Richness Both Prevent Establishment of the Amphibian Fungal Pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis" by Chen et al. 2022. The original github for that project can be found here: https://github.com/mech3132/Project_BiofilmMicrocosm
